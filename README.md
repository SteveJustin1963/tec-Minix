### Minix 
(from mini-Unix) is a Unix-like operating system based on a microkernel architecture. Since version 2.0, it has been Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant. Early versions of MINIX were created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum for educational purposes. POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standard operating system interfaces based on the Unix operating system.

### first released
by Andy Tanenbaum, MINIX 1 in 1987 as an appendix to the book, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. MINIX rapidly became very popular, with a USENET newsgroup being formed with 40,000 readers within 3 months.

### MINIX-specific Features
- Tiny microkernel that runs in kernel mode.
- Most of the operating system runs in user-mode protected processes.
- Each device driver is a separate user-mode process.
- Reincarnation server can reload failed drivers.

### MINIX 3 
is comprehensively redesigned to be "usable as a serious system on resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability." It currently supports only i386 PC compatible systems.

### Z80 Fuzix
is a fork of the Unix-like Fuzix operating system, originally developed for the Z80 microprocessor. The project was started by Andrew Bradley, who reverse-engineered the Z80 processor in order to create a portable version of Unix that could be used on a variety of Z80-based systems. The project was later joined by other developers, who added support for the 8080 and 8086 processors. The Z80 Fuzix operating system is based on the original AT&T Unix operating system, and includes a number of features from other Unix-like operating systems, such as BSD and Linux. The operating system is designed to be portable, and can be run on a variety of Z80-based systems, including the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, and the MSX. The Z80 Fuzix operating system is open source and is released under the GNU General Public License. The source code is available from the project's website.
